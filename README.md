## Abstract

We present a method for automatic assessment of perceived walkability by pedestrians, using a machine learning technique with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on a dataset of georeferenced street-level images obtained from Google Street View. 

## Data

- `streetview.zip` - Dataset of georeferenced street-level images from Google Street View used for training, validation and testing of the CNN model.

### Data Collection and Privacy

The data provided in this repository has been fully anonymized to ensure compliance with privacy regulations and ethical standards. All personally identifiable information has been removed or irreversibly transformed.

The human assessments used to build the training dataset were collected through anonymous online surveys conducted via a custom web-based interface. Participants voluntarily rated street-level images on a scale of perceived walkability, without providing any personal information. No tracking cookies, IP addresses, or other identifying data were collected during the survey process. The survey protocol was designed to ensure complete anonymity of respondents.
